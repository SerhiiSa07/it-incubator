Build a Tribute Page Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to
https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks User Stories: Your tribute page should
have a main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other
elements You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string
(i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman
Borlaug") You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div
Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding
id="image" Within the #img-div element, you should see an element with a
corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the
image shown in #img-div You should see an element with a corresponding
id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the
tribute page You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link",
which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the
subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of
target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab Your
#image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively,
relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
Your img element should be centered within its parent element Fulfill the user
stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own
personal style. Happy Coding! Note: Be sure to add
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /> in your HTML to link your stylesheet
and apply your CSS
